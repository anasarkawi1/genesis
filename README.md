# Genesis, Multi-Chart Algorithmic Trading Microservice

Genesis is a RESTful microservice that leverages Mercury and its financial chart analysis capabilities to build a multi-chart analysis and algorithmic trading suite. Through its RESTful API, multiple Mercury instances can be started each with its own parameters and algorithms. Each of these instances will have a control interface attached to it which the user can then use to directly communicate with the Mercury instance through its own API. The project is based on Mercury and uses FastAPI for its APIs.
